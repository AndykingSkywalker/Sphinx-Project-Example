Sphinx-Test documentation
=========================

Welcome to my project documentation!
This project will be an example of ``Sphinx`` documentation utilising the ``Sphinx RTD Theme``.
I will also be using a CI/CD pipeline to automatically build and deploy the documentation.
I will be using ``Jenkins`` and ``Docker`` for this.
